Hello Guys 😎

Hope you all are doing well.

Let's talk about this file.

It is using :
  1. the amass to find subdomains.
  2. httprobe to find the alive one.

I just automated it for my own ease.

✏ How to Use ✏
◾ Load the file in Linux.
◾ Give execution permission by using chmod +x amassautomated.sh

🏃‍♂️ To run 🏃‍
./amassautomated.sh.sh <domain name>

example :
.amassautomated.sh spacex.com

It will create a folder by the same name as your domain. If you are using the example, it will create a folder by name  spacex.com
The results of the search will be in that folder in two files:
1. final.txt -> this file contains all the subdomains find by the amass
2. alive.txt -> this file contains all the active subdomains find by the amss in first step.

📍Remember 📍
First play with it. You can innovate it further for your own ease. 😍

Thank You
