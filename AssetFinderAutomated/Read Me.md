Hello Guys 😎

Hope you all are doing well.

Let's talk about this file.

It used the Asset Finder by Tomnomnom

I just automated it for my own ease.

✏ How to Use ✏
◾ Load the file in Linux.
◾ Give execution permission by using chmod +x AssetFinderAutomated.sh

🏃‍♂️ To run 🏃‍
./AssetFinderAutomated.sh <domain name>

example :
./AssetFinderAutomated.sh spacex.com

It will create a folder by the same name as your domain. If you are using the example, it will create a folder by name  spacex.com

The results will be in that folder in two files.
  1. final.txt -> this file contains all the subdomains find by the assetfinder
  2. alive.txt -> this file contains all the active subdomains find by the assetfinder in first step.


📍Remember 📍<br>
Asset Finder results by default contains some results that are related to your domain but not the subdomain of the given domain. I have changed it to have only the subdomains of the given domain.

Thank You
